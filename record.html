                        a e-commerce Website but it did not happen. Mainly, it was due to the fact that I did not have a clue 
                        on how to build an e-commerce Website.

                        This Website is built by me, for the purpose of my Shop for my business. Like a Brick and Motar 
                        but online. It accepts Paypal only. It will be updated for more payment gateways soon to have.
                        This is also where I showcase all of my builds, writings, and everything that I can sell on 
                        this Website.
